scala and spark project 

use sbt test to run test cases and answers of questions

on terminal 
sbt test

I have used scala 2.10.5 version and spark 1.6.3 version

it can be downloaded from http://spark.apache.org
and scala can be downloaded from https://www.scala-lang.org/download/

I have used sbt as tool

I can do same in python as well but due to time crunch as I have used mainly scala for spark.

I have worked in C# and python as well.

"sbt test"

based on usecase I have worked on different languages and used different items from hadoop stack.

aspectj logging and exception handling is pending.
